Gemini-2.5-pro was used to generate some small code blocks as noted in the code. 
1. In `server.js`, `toMySQLDateTime` was generated to convert ISO Strings to MYSQL datetimes.
2. The reactive selection code in `DatePicker.jsx`, `Dropdown.jsx`, and `DropDownStatic.jsx`
   was initially generated by AI, but heavily adapted, styled, and tailored for use with the
   current project.

Database backend code (`server.js`) was created with the help of documentation from the framework, 
https://elysiajs.com/at-glance.html.

The CSS Star animation was adapted from Ibrahim Abdulhameed's medium blog post at 
https://ibdul.medium.com/shining-bright-the-starry-css-background-that-lit-up-my-ui-d19acb862dff.
 My original modification was adding a fade-in and fade-out animation at the start and end of the 
 star animation to reduce the jitter, and I modified the looks of the stars to be round and move
 at different speeds.
